# BTEC General Computing & Systems Development Higher National Diploma assignments
Greetings!

This repository consists of a collection of 16 units in total of all the assignments I did as part of my Edexcel BTEC HND in General Computing & Systems Development. You can read more about it [here](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/qualifications/btec-higher-nationals/computing-2017.html).

The [Edexcel](https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/home.html) website describes it as: 

> The new BTEC Higher National qualifications in Computing are designed
> to address an increasing need for high-quality professional and
> technical education pathways at Levels 4 and 5, thereby providing
> students with a clear line of sight to employment or progression to a
> degree at Level 6.

Please refer the "Assignments Scenario" directory to see the scenario for each assingment, the assignment scenario is categorized to L4, L4 Optional, L5 and L5 optional so that you can understand my interests.
